Students will use models to gain insight into how a physiological system functions and to design a biomedical engineering device or procedure that interacts with the physiological system.  Systems studied include the cardiovascular system,  gas exchange in the lungs, nerve and muscle action potentials, and musculo-skeletal spinal reflex.",

Students translate their understanding of physiological systems into models that evolve dynamically based on engineering block diagrams.  Additional topics include: hierarchical structure, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, negative feedback control, and characteristic traits of models.  Students will use models to gain insight into how a physiological system functions and to design a biomedical engineering device or procedure that interacts with the physiological system.  Systems studied include the cardiovascular system,  gas exchange in the lungs, nerve and muscle action potentials, and musculo-skeletal spinal reflex.",
